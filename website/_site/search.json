These scores quantify the overall tone of news articles on a continuous scale, offering insight into the emotional framing of events and issues over time.\nRather than centering on specific political events, this analysis takes a broad temporal view to uncover overarching trends in news tone. We investigate whether certain networks consistently portray the news with a more positive or negative tone, and how those patterns may shift across months and years."

    "text": "1.2 Understanding GDELT Tone Scores\nBefore diving into the analysis, it’s essential to understand how GDELT tone scores are computed and what they represent. These scores provide a quantitative measure of emotional tone in global news coverage, enabling systematic comparisons across sources and time periods.\n\nTone Score: This metric typically ranges from -10 (extremely negative) to +10 (extremely positive), with 0 indicating a neutral tone. It reflects the overall sentiment conveyed in a news article or segment.\nCalculation Method: GDELT applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment by analyzing the frequency and intensity of positive and negative language within each document.\nComposite Measure: The tone score is derived as the difference between positive and negative sentiment components, providing a net emotional tone. In later sections, we’ll explore these components individually for a more detailed breakdown.\n\nHigher tone scores indicate a stronger presence of positive language, while lower scores reflect more negative framing. These values allow us to track and visualize long-term sentiment trends, evaluate tone consistency or volatility, and compare differences in emotional framing across news networks with varying political orientations."

    "text": "1.4 Tone Distribution Analysis\nThe dashed horizontal line at 0 represents a neutral tone, serving as a visual reference point to highlight how all three networks tend to lean toward negative sentiment in their reporting. This trend may reflect the nature of media content itself, where negative events often receive more attention and coverage due to their perceived newsworthiness.\nAll three news networks skew slightly negative in their average tone scores, consistent with prior findings that news coverage tends to focus more on conflict, controversy, and crisis. Fox News has an average tone score of –2.69, MSNBC averages –2.74, and ABC News is the most negative on average at –3.10.\nWhile the overall shapes of the tone distributions are broadly similar, a few important distinctions emerge. ABC News, despite being considered a centrist outlet, exhibits a slightly more negative average tone and a wider distribution, indicating greater variability in emotional framing across its stories. This suggests that ABC may present a broader range of sentiment—from highly negative to moderately positive—compared to the other networks, which tend to cluster more tightly around their respective means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tone score distribution across news networks"

    "text": "1.5 Outlier Analysis of Tone Scores by Network\nThe bar chart above visualizes the number of tone score outliers—both negative and positive—for each news network, based on the 1.5×IQR rule.\n\nABC News has the highest number of outliers overall, with 1,733 negative and 643 positive outliers. This aligns with the earlier observation of ABC’s wider tone distribution, suggesting a greater range in emotional framing.\nFox News reports 1,142 negative and 449 positive outliers, placing it in the middle across both categories.\nMSNBC, notably, shows 1,393 negative and 548 positive outliers—despite having fewer total articles in the dataset compared to ABC and Fox. This indicates that MSNBC’s tone scores, while stemming from a smaller sample, exhibit a relatively high rate of extreme sentiment (especially on the negative end).\n\nThis pattern reinforces earlier findings that MSNBC’s tone distribution is highly skewed and variable, and that ABC News, though centrist in political alignment, features the most extreme tone scores overall.
