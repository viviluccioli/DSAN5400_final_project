    "text": "1.1 Overview\nThis section examines long-term sentiment trends across three major U.S. news networks—Fox News, MSNBC, and ABC News—using tone scores derived from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) from 2015 through 2025. These scores quantify the overall tone of news articles on a continuous scale, offering insight into the emotional framing of events and issues over time.\nRather than centering on specific political events, this analysis takes a broad temporal view to uncover overarching trends in news tone. We investigate whether certain networks consistently portray the news with a more positive or negative tone, and how those patterns may shift across months and years."

    "text": "1.2 Understanding GDELT Tone Scores\nBefore diving into the analysis, it’s essential to understand how GDELT tone scores are computed and what they represent. These scores provide a quantitative measure of emotional tone in global news coverage, enabling systematic comparisons across sources and time periods.\n\nTone Score: This metric typically ranges from -10 (extremely negative) to +10 (extremely positive), with 0 indicating a neutral tone. It reflects the overall sentiment conveyed in a news article or segment.\nCalculation Method: GDELT applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment by analyzing the frequency and intensity of positive and negative language within each document.\nComposite Measure: The tone score is derived as the difference between positive and negative sentiment components, providing a net emotional tone. In later sections, we’ll explore these components individually for a more detailed breakdown.\n\nHigher tone scores indicate a stronger presence of positive language, while lower scores reflect more negative framing. These values allow us to track and visualize long-term sentiment trends, evaluate tone consistency or volatility, and compare differences in emotional framing across news networks with varying political orientations."

    "text": "1.4 Tone Distribution Analysis\nThe dashed horizontal line at 0 represents a neutral tone, serving as a visual reference point to highlight how all three networks tend to lean toward negative sentiment in their reporting. This trend may reflect the nature of media content itself, where negative events often receive more attention and coverage due to their perceived newsworthiness.\nAll three news networks skew slightly negative in their average tone scores, consistent with prior findings that news coverage tends to focus more on conflict, controversy, and crisis. Fox News has an average tone score of –2.69, MSNBC averages –2.74, and ABC News is the most negative on average at –3.10.\nWhile the overall shapes of the tone distributions are broadly similar, a few important distinctions emerge. ABC News, despite being considered a centrist outlet, exhibits a slightly more negative average tone and a wider distribution, indicating greater variability in emotional framing across its stories. This suggests that ABC may present a broader range of sentiment—from highly negative to moderately positive—compared to the other networks, which tend to cluster more tightly around their respective means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tone score distribution across news networks"

Fox News sentiment improves during Republican leadership, while MSNBC sentiment dips more sharply during these periods, suggesting a substantial relationship between political alignment and emotional framing.\nOutlier Analysis: The significant number of outliers, particularly from ABC News and MSNBC despite its smaller sample size, indicates that extreme framing—especially negative framing—plays an important role in how these networks cover certain stories."

    "text": "1.1 5-Day Average Tone Around the 2016 Election\nThis figure shows the 5-day rolling average tone scores for MSNBC, ABC News, and Fox News during the 60-day period surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election (October 9–December 8). Tone was measured using GDELT’s tone scores, where lower values represent more negative sentiment.\nLeading up to Election Day (marked by the red dashed line), all three networks maintained negative overall tone, with MSNBC generally exhibiting the most negative coverage, followed by ABC News and Fox News. Tone across networks reached its least negative point around Election Day itself, suggesting a temporary moderation in reporting tone during the immediate election period.\nIn the post-election period, MSNBC’s tone shifted sharply toward a more neutral or even slightly positive direction, peaking roughly two to three weeks after the election. ABC News displayed a smaller but similarly positive shift, while Fox News’ tone remained comparatively stable with only minor fluctuations. These post-election trends may reflect different editorial responses to the election outcome: MSNBC and ABC News may have covered post-election reactions, protests, or policy uncertainty with varied tone shifts, while Fox News’ steadier sentiment suggests less divergence from its pre-election reporting tone.\nNotably, at the very end of the 60-day window, both MSNBC and ABC News show large positive spikes in average tone scores. These sharp increases could be due to several factors, such as the seasonal effect of late-November and December news coverage shifting toward holiday stories, end-of-year recaps, or less election-focused reporting, all of which typically feature more positive or neutral language. Fox News did not show a comparable spike, indicating that editorial or thematic focus during this time may have differed significantly across networks.\nOverall, these patterns highlight both a convergence of reporting tone during the election and a divergence afterward, with clear differences emerging between the networks in their post-election coverage tone trajectories.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 1: Animated tone trends around the 2020 election (Oct 4–Dec 3)\n\n\n\n\nconclusions\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 2: Animated tone trends around the 2024 election (Oct 6–Dec 5)"
