    "text": "Overview\nThis section examines long-term sentiment trends across three major U.S. news networks—Fox News, MSNBC, and ABC News—using tone scores derived from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) from 2015 through 2025. These scores quantify the overall tone of news articles on a continuous scale, offering insight into the emotional framing of events and issues over time.\nRather than centering on specific political events, this analysis takes a broad temporal view to uncover overarching trends in news tone. We investigate whether certain networks consistently portray the news with a more positive or negative tone, and how those patterns may shift across months and years."

    "text": "Understanding GDELT Tone Scores\nBefore diving into the analysis, it’s essential to understand how GDELT tone scores are computed and what they represent. These scores provide a quantitative measure of emotional tone in global news coverage, enabling systematic comparisons across sources and time periods.\n\nTone Score: This metric typically ranges from -10 (extremely negative) to +10 (extremely positive), with 0 indicating a neutral tone. It reflects the overall sentiment conveyed in a news article or segment.\nCalculation Method: GDELT applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment by analyzing the frequency and intensity of positive and negative language within each document.\nComposite Measure: The tone score is derived as the difference between positive and negative sentiment components, providing a net emotional tone. In later sections, we’ll explore these components individually for a more detailed breakdown.\n\nHigher tone scores indicate a stronger presence of positive language, while lower scores reflect more negative framing. These values allow us to track and visualize long-term sentiment trends, evaluate tone consistency or volatility, and compare differences in emotional framing across news networks with varying political orientations."

    "text": "Tone Distribution Analysis\nThe dashed horizontal line at 0 represents a neutral tone, serving as a visual reference point to highlight how all three networks tend to lean toward negative sentiment in their reporting. This trend may reflect the nature of media content itself, where negative events often receive more attention and coverage due to their perceived newsworthiness.\nAll three news networks skew slightly negative in their average tone scores, consistent with prior findings that news coverage tends to focus more on conflict, controversy, and crisis. Fox News has an average tone score of –2.69, MSNBC averages –2.74, and ABC News is the most negative on average at –3.10.\nWhile the overall shapes of the tone distributions are broadly similar, a few important distinctions emerge. ABC News, despite being considered a centrist outlet, exhibits a slightly more negative average tone and a wider distribution, indicating greater variability in emotional framing across its stories. This suggests that ABC may present a broader range of sentiment—from highly negative to moderately positive—compared to the other networks, which tend to cluster more tightly around their respective means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tone score distribution across news networks"

This aligns with the earlier observation of ABC’s wider tone distribution, suggesting a greater range in emotional framing.\nFox News reports 1,142 negative and 449 positive outliers, placing it in the middle across both categories.\nMSNBC, notably, shows 1,393 negative and 548 positive outliers—despite having fewer total articles in the dataset compared to ABC and Fox. This indicates that MSNBC’s tone scores, while stemming from a smaller sample, exhibit a relatively high rate of extreme sentiment (especially on the negative end).\n\nThis pattern reinforces earlier findings that MSNBC’s tone distribution is highly skewed and variable, and that ABC News, though centrist in political alignment, features the most extreme tone scores overall.

Fox News sentiment improves during Republican leadership, while MSNBC sentiment dips more sharply during these periods, suggesting a substantial relationship between political alignment and emotional framing.\nOutlier Analysis: The significant number of outliers, particularly from ABC News and MSNBC despite its smaller sample size, indicates that extreme framing—especially negative framing—plays an important role in how these networks cover certain stories."

Tone was measured using GDELT’s tone scores, where lower values represent more negative sentiment.\nLeading up to Election Day (marked by the red dashed line), all three networks maintained negative overall tone, with MSNBC generally exhibiting the most negative coverage, followed by ABC News and Fox News. Tone across networks reached its least negative point around Election Day itself, suggesting a temporary moderation in reporting tone during the immediate election period.\nIn the post-election period, MSNBC’s tone shifted sharply toward a more neutral or even slightly positive direction, peaking roughly two to three weeks after the election. ABC News displayed a smaller but similarly positive shift, while Fox News’ tone remained comparatively stable with only minor fluctuations. These post-election trends may reflect different editorial responses to the election outcome: MSNBC and ABC News may have covered post-election reactions, protests, or policy uncertainty with varied tone shifts, while Fox News’ steadier sentiment suggests less divergence from its pre-election reporting tone.\nNotably, at the very end of the 60-day window, both MSNBC and ABC News show large positive spikes in average tone scores. These sharp increases could be due to several factors, such as the seasonal effect of late-November and December news coverage shifting toward holiday stories, end-of-year recaps, or less election-focused reporting, all of which typically feature more positive or neutral language. Fox News did not show a comparable spike, indicating that editorial or thematic focus during this time may have differed significantly across networks.\nOverall, these patterns highlight both a convergence of reporting tone during the election and a divergence afterward, with clear differences emerging between the networks in their post-election coverage tone trajectories."

These dates follow Donald Trump’s election victory, suggesting celebratory or favorable coverage of the president-elect’s activities and appointments.\nNovember 18, 2016 – MSNBC: Registered a significant negative tone. This may reflect critical reporting on Trump’s transition plans or cabinet selections, which were subjects of scrutiny during this time.\nNovember 24, 2016 – MSNBC: Showed a pronounced positive tone. The Thanksgiving holiday could have influenced a shift towards more uplifting or human-interest stories, temporarily altering the network’s typical tone.\nNovember 27, 2016 – Fox News: Experienced a notable negative tone. This could be associated with coverage of post-election protests or controversies surrounding the incoming administration.\nDecember 8, 2016 – ABC News: Exhibited a significant positive tone. As the year-end approached, the network may have focused on more positive stories or retrospectives, contributing to this tonal shift."

    "text": "1.4 After the Election (Nov 9 – Dec 8)\n\nNovember 11 & 20, 2016 – Fox News: Displayed unusually positive tones. These dates follow Donald Trump’s election victory, suggesting celebratory or favorable coverage of the president-elect’s activities and appointments.\nNovember 18, 2016 – MSNBC: Registered a significant negative tone. This may reflect critical reporting on Trump’s transition plans or cabinet selections, which were subjects of scrutiny during this time.\nNovember 24, 2016 – MSNBC: Showed a pronounced positive tone. The Thanksgiving holiday could have influenced a shift towards more uplifting or human-interest stories, temporarily altering the network’s typical tone.\nNovember 27, 2016 – Fox News: Experienced a notable negative tone. This could be associated with coverage of post-election protests or controversies surrounding the incoming administration.\nDecember 8, 2016 – ABC News: Exhibited a significant positive tone. As the year-end approached, the network may have focused on more positive stories or retrospectives, contributing to this tonal shift."

    "text": "5-Day Average Tone Around the 2020 Election\n\nIn the post-election period, MSNBC’s tone shifted sharply toward a more neutral or even slightly positive direction, peaking roughly two to three weeks after the election. ABC News displayed a smaller but similarly positive shift, while Fox News’ tone remained comparatively stable with only minor fluctuations. These post-election trends may reflect different editorial responses to the election outcome: MSNBC and ABC News may have covered post-election reactions, protests, or policy uncertainty with varied tone shifts, while Fox News’ steadier sentiment suggests less divergence from its pre-election reporting tone.\nNotably, at the very end of the 60-day window, both MSNBC and ABC News show large positive spikes in average tone scores. These sharp increases could be due to several factors, such as the seasonal effect of late-November and December news coverage shifting toward holiday stories, end-of-year recaps, or less election-focused reporting, all of which typically feature more positive or neutral language.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 1: 5-Day average tone trends around the 2020 election (Oct 4–Dec 3)"

    "text": "Outlier Days in News Network Tone (Oct 9–Dec 8, 2020)\nThis section highlights days when MSNBC, ABC News, or Fox News showed unusually sharp changes in tone surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nBefore the Election (Oct 9 – Nov 2)\n\nOctober 9, 2020 – Fox News: Registered a sharply negative tone. This coincides with coverage following the first presidential debate and President Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization earlier in October.\nOctober 17, 2020 – ABC News: Displayed highly negative tone, likely related to intensified election coverage, including town halls with Biden and Trump and rising COVID-19 case counts nationwide.\nOctober 25, 2020 – ABC News: Again showed very negative tone during a critical stretch of the campaign, with widespread focus on record early voting numbers and final debate performances.\nNovember 1, 2020 – MSNBC: Recorded an extremely negative tone just two days before the election, possibly reflecting anxiety over voter suppression concerns, COVID-19 surges, or final campaign attacks.\n\n\n\nAfter the Election (Nov 4 – Dec 8)\n\nNovember 13, 2020 – MSNBC: Showed a sharply positive tone. This corresponds to post-election coverage focusing on President-elect Biden’s transition plans and early cabinet appointments.\nNovember 13, 2020 – ABC News: Also showed an unusually positive tone on the same day, likely driven by similar transition coverage or optimistic reporting about the end of election-related uncertainty.\nNovember 14, 2020 – ABC News: Returned to very negative tone, possibly reflecting escalating tensions as Trump and allies continued to challenge election results without evidence.\nNovember 28, 2020 – MSNBC: Displayed a positive tone, possibly influenced by lighter, post-Thanksgiving news coverage and growing acceptance of the election outcome.\nDecember 3, 2020 – Fox News: Registered a positive tone. By this time, reporting may have shifted toward acknowledging the Biden transition more openly, despite lingering contestations."

Its coverage showed a gradual improvement before the election, with a notable positive spike approximately one week after Election Day before returning to more moderate negative values.\nMSNBC displayed the most dramatic fluctuations, beginning the period with extremely negative tone (below -4) before improving steadily toward the election. After a significant positive shift around November 10, MSNBC’s tone became increasingly volatile, alternating between more positive and more negative reporting in the post-election weeks.\nABC News showed more stability than MSNBC but still exhibited noticeable tone shifts, particularly improving in the immediate pre-election period. After Election Day, ABC maintained a fairly steady moderate negative tone, with less dramatic fluctuations than the other networks.\nAll three networks demonstrated a pattern of increasingly less negative coverage as Election Day approached, with their most positive (or least negative) tones occurring in the week following the election rather than on Election Day itself. This suggests that post-election dynamics, rather than the voting process, may have driven more positive coverage across the media landscape."
