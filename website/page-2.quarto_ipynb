ABC News displayed a smaller but similarly positive shift, while Fox News' tone remained comparatively stable with only minor fluctuations. These post-election trends may reflect different editorial responses to the election outcome: MSNBC and ABC News may have covered post-election reactions, protests, or policy uncertainty with varied tone shifts, while Fox News' steadier sentiment suggests less divergence from its pre-election reporting tone.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **October 17, 2020 â€“ ABC News**: Displayed highly negative tone, likely related to intensified election coverage, including town halls with Biden and Trump and rising COVID-19 case counts nationwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **October 25, 2020 â€“ ABC News**: Again showed very negative tone during a critical stretch of the campaign, with widespread focus on record early voting numbers and final debate performances.\n",

        "* **November 1, 2020 â€“ MSNBC**: Recorded an extremely negative tone just two days before the election, possibly reflecting anxiety over voter suppression concerns, COVID-19 surges, or final campaign attacks.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **November 13, 2020 â€“ ABC News**: Also showed an unusually positive tone on the same day, likely driven by similar transition coverage or optimistic reporting about the end of election-related uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **November 14, 2020 â€“ ABC News**: Returned to very negative tone, possibly reflecting escalating tensions as Trump and allies continued to challenge election results without evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **November 28, 2020 â€“ MSNBC**: Displayed a positive tone, possibly influenced by lighter, post-Thanksgiving news coverage and growing acceptance of the election outcome.\n",

        "* **December 3, 2020 â€“ Fox News**: Registered a positive tone. By this time, reporting may have shifted toward acknowledging the Biden transition more openly, despite lingering contestations.\n",

        "\n",
        "- All three major networks (Fox News, MSNBC, and ABC News) maintained largely negative tone throughout election periods across 2016, 2020, and 2024.\n",
        "- Fox News consistently displayed the least negative tone in all three election cycles.\n",
        "- MSNBC typically exhibited the most negative coverage, particularly before elections.\n",
        "- All networks showed tone moderation (less negativity) around Election Day itself.\n",
        "- Post-election coverage revealed network-specific patterns, with MSNBC and ABC News showing notable positive shifts after elections, while Fox News maintained more consistent tone."
